# AI-LT-AutomaticallyI-Identification-License-Terms-
we propose a novel framework(AI LT) for automatically performing identification of open source software license terms. This model consists of three key components, license modeling module for license dimensions extraction, topic model based on LDA to mine the topics in licenses, and topics and dimension mapping module for construction of their relationships.
